                        <p>
                            A diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart
                            disease
                            and stroke, prevent some
                            types of cancer, lower risk of eye and digestive problems, and have a positive effect upon
                            blood
                            sugar, which can help
                            keep appetite in check. Eating non-starchy vegetables and fruits like apples, pears, and
                            green
                            leafy vegetables may even
                            promote weight loss. Their low glycemic loads prevent blood sugar spikes that can increase
                            hunger.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            At least nine different families of fruits and vegetables exist, each with potentially
                            hundreds of different plant
                            compounds that are beneficial to health. Eat a variety of types and colors of produce in
                            order to give your body the mix
                            of nutrients it needs. This not only ensures a greater diversity of beneficial plant
                            chemicals but also creates
                            eye-appealing meals.

                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Most of us don't hit our recommended fiber intake (that's 38g/day for men and 25g/day for
                            women). Eating high-fiber
                            foods like whole grains, fruits, legumes, nuts and yes, vegetables can help you get enough
                            of this key nutrient. Fiber
                            is great for your heart and gut, but also can keep you full and reduce your risk of
                            developing diabetes. All vegetables
                            have fiber, so choose a variety to get your fill.

                    <h3>Cardiovascular disease</h3>
                    <p>The higher the average daily intake of fruits and vegetables, the lower the chances of developing
                        cardiovascular
                        disease. Compared with those in the lowest category of fruit and vegetable intake (less than 1.5
                        servings a day), those
                        who averaged 8 or more servings a day were 30% less likely to have had a heart attack or
                        stroke..</p>
                    <h3>Blood pressure</h3>
                    <p>A randomized trial known as the Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health (OmniHeart)
                        showed that this fruit
                        and vegetable-rich diet lowered blood pressure even more when some of the carbohydrate was
                        replaced with healthy
                        unsaturated fat or protein.</p>
                    <h3>Diabetes</h3>
                    <p>A study of over 2,300 Finnish men showed that vegetables and fruits, especially berries, may
                        reduce the risk of type 2
                        diabetes.</p>
