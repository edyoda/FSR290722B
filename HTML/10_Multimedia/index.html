    <h2>Embedding</h2>
    <p>Reference: <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Other_embedding_technologies"></a>
    </p>
    <p> A little while later (late 90s, early 2000s), plugin technologies became very popular, such as Java Applets and
        Flash — these allowed web developers to embed rich content into webpages such as videos and animations, which
        just weren't available through HTML alone. Embedding these technologies was achieved through elements like
        object, and the lesser-used embed, and they were very useful at the time. They have since fallen out of
        fashion due to many problems, including accessibility, security, file size, and more. These days major
        browsers have stopped supporting plugins such as Flash.

    <h3><code>iframe</code></h3>
    <p>iframe elements are designed to allow you to embed other web documents into the current document. This is great
        for incorporating third-party content into your website that you might not have direct control over and don't
        want to have to implement your own version of — such as video from online video providers, commenting systems
        like Disqus, maps from online map providers, advertising banners, etc. The live editable examples you've been
        using through this course are implemented using iframes.</p>

    <h2>The <code>embed</code> and <code>object</code> elements</h2>
    <p>The embed and object elements serve a different function to iframe — these elements are general purpose embedding
        tools for embedding external content, such as PDFs.</p>
    <p>Historically these elements have also been used for embedding content handled by browser plugins such as Adobe
        Flash,
        but this technology is now obsolete and is not supported by modern browsers.</p>
